# Garbage Detection and Segmentation

This project aims to detect and segment garbage in images using a U-Net model. The model is trained on a dataset of images with corresponding color-coded segmentation masks.

## Project Structure

- **DataSet:** Contains the training and testing images and their corresponding labels.
- **my_model.h5:** The saved U-Net model after training.
- **GarbageDetectionSegmentation.ipynb:** The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
